# Amazon Sales Data Analysis
sourced the dataset from the following link: [(https://github.com/sangwanamit621/Sales-and-Revenue-Analysis/blob/main/AllYearSales.csv)]
I utilized MongoDB to ingest and organize data, and applied aggregation pipelines to extract valuable insights from the dataset. Some of the specific insights derived include:

1. Total Revenue from Phone Category in April 2019: I calculated the total revenue generated from the "Phone" category during the month of April 2019.

2. Top-Selling Products by Revenue: I identified and ranked the top-selling products based on their revenue contribution.

3. Total Sales Revenue by State**: I crafted a query to display the total sales revenue for each state, sorting the results in descending order. This provided a clear picture of the states with the highest sales revenue.

4. Average Order Value by Product Category: I computed the average order value for each product category, allowing us to evaluate the performance of different product categories.

These insights offer valuable information for business decision-making, enabling data-driven strategies and optimizations. If you require further details or specific results, please feel free to ask.
